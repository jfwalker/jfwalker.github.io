Oct 4th

I recently published a piece about the prevelance of the evolutionary history of genes in the chloroplast genome, [conflicting with eachother](https://peerj.com/articles/7747/). This was done with former undergraduate Nat Walker-Hale, who is also co-first author! This was done with the amazing help of Oscar Vargas, Greg Stull, and marks the first publication of Drew Larson.

I'm putting together a website, as you can tell it is currently under development, more soon.
