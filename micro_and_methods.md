### Comparative trait analysis using microscopy

From a background in macro-evolution something such as the bullseye pattern on flowers would be treated as a trait. But with the development of new forms of digital microscopy, it is now possible to study the components underlying traits such as a bullseye pattern. By disentangling the detailed components that comprise a bullseye spot (e.g. cell shape, cell type, distribution), we can actually examine how this trait is gained and lost. The small Trionum clade in _Hibiscus_ provides an example of convergence on the spot, please see the phylogenetic section of the website, and this provide the ideal system to study the cellular changes that vary among the species.
