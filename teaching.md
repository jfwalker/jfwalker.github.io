### Teaching

Teaching is one of the most important aspects of being an academic, this includes educating students in the class room, mentoring students, creating workshops for the scientific community, and reaching out to the public through outreach. For more information about outreach please see my page on [outreach](https://jfwalker.github.io/outreach/). In the classroom teaching can have a major influence on a students career decisions, and the same goes for mentoring. The amazing experiences I had in the labs of [Dr. Michael Zanis](https://www.seattleu.edu/scieng/about/faculty-and-staff/), [Dr. Nancy Emery](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/emery/), and visiting [Dr. Antonia Monteiro](http://lepdata.org/monteiro/), are the reason that I pursued a PhD. The classroom is a place where people not only become educated but have their views shaped, and I see it as my responsibility as an educator to make sure students know why we infer patterns from the data and not just what patterns have been seen. A paper that illustrates the importance of understanding the science underlying inference, as opposed to just what is inferred can be found [here](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/36/9587). As influential as any science paper can be, education has as much if not more potential to bring about great change, even if there is not the same quantification of that change.

## Classes I have taught

**During my PhD at University of Michigan**

_Guest Lecturer_: Phylogenetic methods and theory. 

_Supervised Teaching_: This is the only non-science class I have taught and it was on pedagogy. At University of Michigan I was a graduate student mentor and as such during this class I helped a group of five graduate students with some techniques on teaching. These were students that either struggled with teaching in the classroom or did not have experience teaching. The graduate students would attend a class I taught to see what techniques worked for me, and I would attend a class they taught to see places where they may need help. I learned a lot about different teaching styles, and found that what students reacted to the most was the comfort level of the instructor. If someone is comfortable giving a lecture or giving a talk then the audience naturally feeds off that comfort, but when someone is uncomfortable then the class becomes a bit uncomfortable. This led to the challenge of figuring out what lecture style allowed each graduate student to be comfortable when they were presenting, which turned out to be different for everyone.

_Evolution_: I taught this class twice and it was an upper level undergraduate class on evolution. My class sizes ranged from four students at the very undesirable 8:30am during winter time slot, to about 20 students for daytime recitations. My job was to go over the lecture with the students and discuss any issues they might have had, it was very easy to notice that students are not open about the material they had trouble with in lecture. As such we discussed the core concepts of lecture and they would discuss in groups how to design experiments to test key concepts. 

_Introduction to Ecology and Evolution_: This was a very structured class, that gave an overview of basic concepts in Ecology and Evolution. The bulk of designing the recitations was done by [Dr. Laura Eidietis](https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb/people/faculty/leidieti.html), who did an incredible job making sure all recitations covered the same subjects. Overall, my main role was to attend the recitation and help students with concepts that were covered in the recitation sheets.
