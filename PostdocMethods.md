### Evolutionary genomics

The overarching questions I pursue in evolutionary genomics are largely with regards to large scale phylogenetic datasets (sometimes called phylogenomics). Typically, I use this data to search for patterns that can inform us of evolutionary events that may have shifted a lineages evolutionary trajectory. These events include, ancient genome duplication, gene evolutionary histories in conflict with species histories, and genes containing disproportionate influence on an analysis. My main goal is to not only understand the relationships of the group I am studying, but understand what patterns and processes have led to these relationships.

**methods development**

Most of the programs I have written, please see the [programming page](https://jfwalker.github.io/research/Postdoc_data_analysis/), have been designed with genome scale phylogenetic datasets in mind. These often leverage the evolutionary relationships seen in the gene trees, to better understand the species relationships inferred.

### Genomics

Full genome data has become integral to many modern molecular projects. In my postdoc work the lab has benefited greatly from short read data provided to us by the [10kp project](https://db.cngb.org/10kp/). This data was short read data, that I was able to assemble into a highly fragmented genome. The major advantage is, even though the genome is fragmented, when we need promoter regions or complete coding sequences when the transcriptome data does not have it all, this provides the perfect complement and allows the lab to avoid genome walking.
