### Current projects

**Large Scale Phylogenetics of Hibiscus**

Although _Hibiscus trionum_ remains an exemplar system for studying [bullseye patterns and iridescence](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24285), the species exists in an equally exciting group called the Trionum complex. This small clade has yet to be characterized from an evolutionary standpoint. A project I am currently working on that leads into future projects is placing these species and sub-species in phylogenies, for downstream trait analysis and characterization.

**A species tree and depiction of gene tree conflict across the Trionum clade of _Hibiscus_. The species tree is depicted in purple and the gene trees are depicted as a cloudogram in white. This figure was generated using [densitree](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~remco/DensiTree/).**


**Phylogenomics of Caryophyllales**

I've been involved in a number of papers that focus on the order Caryophyllales. This is an order of plants with particularly fascinating histories. To start from a morphological standpoint they are hyperdiverse, below is a picture of the non-core Caryophyllales which contains the carnivorous plants, however, the Caryophyllales as a whole also contains Cacti. Part of my thesis involved figuring out the relationships among the families within the order. This was the From [Cacti to Carnivores paper](https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajb2.1069) in the AJB Tree of Life issue, and with the widespread phylogenetically diverse sampling and massive amounts of lab work that had to be done, this represented a huge collaborative effort, with many PI's, postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates coming together to make this possible.

**This depicts the relationships inferred for the non-core Caryophyllales. The branch highlighted in red depicts where there is conflict between the different species tree reconstruction methods. Gene tree conflict is depicted in pie charts**


Other projects that I have been involved in have found some other interesting evolutionary patterns among the Caryophyllales. Within the non-core above, the first analysis I conducted in my PhD found the group had a large number of inferred genome duplications. [This paper](https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3732/ajb.1700083) was focused on studying the molecular evolution of the carnvirous plants. From a methodological perspective the paper also illustrates how sensitive a relationship can be to sampling, even when using genome scale data. The picture below depicts the inferred relationships from the first chapter of my PhD.

**This is the depiction of the non-core Caryophyllales relationships from the first chapter of my PhD. Gene tree conflict is again depicted on pie charts, major evolutionary changes are shown on the branches they inferred to have occured, the numbers on the branches are the predicted number of gene duplications to have occured on the branch, and the circles represent the inferred genome duplications**


Some other projects I have been involved in have contributed to the body of literature in Caryophyllales by showing the Order as a whole has a propensity for [genome duplications](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.14812), these duplications are correlated with [rate shifts and moving to new enviornments](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.14772), and the family Portulacineae (containing Cacti and relatives) have some potentially important [gene family duplications with respect to C4 and CAM photosynthesis](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/36/1/112/5146340).


### Chloroplast phylogenetics

The chloroplast is one of the best studied genomes on earth, and also contains _matK_ a gene that the majority of our knowledge of the plant tree of life is based off of. One thing that has not been as heavily studied is the amount of conflict that underlies the chloroplast dataset. Although, this conflict between the chloroplast genes and the genome may be the result of the methods and not biological it is still important to factor into our analyses, especially as chloroplasts are easy to obtain with next generation sequencing. [In a paper](https://peerj.com/articles/7747/) I co-authored with Nat Walker-Hale, an undergraduate I mentored, we explored the extent to which the genes in the chloroplast conflict with our knowledge of relationships based on the whole chloroplast and based on nuclear data. I did some [previous work](https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3732/ajb.1400049) on examining the relationships of the major sections in Asteraceae during my Master's thesis and wrote a paper detailing one of the [most common misconceptions](https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3732/ajb.1500299) about chloroplast genomes (the different orientations of the SSC are not an evolutionary even).

**I wish I could take credit for this image but it was all Nat and is one of my favorite figures from any paper I've been on. The circle diagrams are the chloroplast genomes, ordered by gene length, colored by amount of gene tree conflict, and broken into separate time scales. Below the circle diagrams are the correlates of the conflict.**


### Phylogenetics of _Lasthenia_

_Lasthenia_ is an amazing genus, first off it is named after one of Plato's only [female students](http://www.societyforthestudyofwomenphilosophers.org/Lasthenia_of_Mantinea.html), who wanted to study philosophy at a time when this was not acceptable for women, so she would dress as a man to attend the classes. The genus named in her recognition exhibits some amazing ecological convergence. The plants appear to have converged on living in extreme habitats such as vernal pools and when they flower they form what appears to be fields of gold (hence the common name goldfields). I was lucky enough to see this happen thanks to grants from SICB and the California Native Plant society. I've attached a picture below, and if you are in the west (predominantely California and Oregon, but one of them also lives in Chile) they are really worth seeing. In this work I used the computationally expensive but completely worth it program Bali-phy, which integrates over not only the model but also the uncertainty of the alignment. The phylogenetic work was incorporated with some really cool work on tolerance curves by Silas Tittes and can be found [here](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/701827).
