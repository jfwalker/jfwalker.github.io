### Current projects

**Large Scale Phylogenetics of Hibiscus**

Although _Hibiscus trionum_ remains an exemplar system for studying [bullseye patterns and iridescence](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24285), the species exists in an equally exciting group called the Trionum complex. This small clade has yet to be characterized from an evolutionary standpoint. A project I am currently working on that leads into future projects is placing these species and sub-species in phylogenies, for downstream trait analysis and characterization.

**Phylogenomics of Caryophyllales**

I've been involved in a number of papers that focus on the order Caryophyllales. This is an order of plants with particularly fascinating histories. To start from a morphological standpoint they are hyperdiverse, below is a picture of the non-core Caryophyllales which contains the carnivorous plants, however, the Caryophyllales as a whole also contains Cacti. Part of my thesis involved figuring out the relationships among the families within the order. This was the From [Cacti to Carnivores paper](https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajb2.1069) in the AJB Tree of Life issue, and with the widespread phylogenetically diverse sampling and massive amounts of lab work that had to be done, this represented a huge collaborative effort, with many PI's, postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates coming together to make this possible.
