### Current projects

**Large Scale Phylogenetics of Hibiscus**

Although _Hibiscus trionum_ remains an exemplar system for studying [bullseye patterns and iridescence](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24285), the species exists in an equally exciting group called the Trionum complex. This small clade has yet to be characterized from an evolutionary standpoint. A project I am currently working on that leads into future projects is placing these species and sub-species in phylogenies, for downstream trait analysis and characterization.

**A species tree and depiction of gene tree conflict across the Trionum clade of _Hibiscus_. The species tree is depicted in purple and the gene trees are depicted as a cloudogram in white. This figure was generated using [densitree](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~remco/DensiTree/).**


**Phylogenomics of Caryophyllales**

I've been involved in a number of papers that focus on the order Caryophyllales. This is an order of plants with particularly fascinating histories. To start from a morphological standpoint they are hyperdiverse, below is a picture of the non-core Caryophyllales which contains the carnivorous plants, however, the Caryophyllales as a whole also contains Cacti. Part of my thesis involved figuring out the relationships among the families within the order. This was the From [Cacti to Carnivores paper](https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajb2.1069) in the AJB Tree of Life issue, and with the widespread phylogenetically diverse sampling and massive amounts of lab work that had to be done, this represented a huge collaborative effort, with many PI's, postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates coming together to make this possible.

**This depicts the relationships inferred for the non-core Caryophyllales. The branch highlighted in red depicts where there is conflict between the different species tree reconstruction methods. Gene tree conflict is depicted in pie charts**


Other projects that I have been involved in have found some other interesting evolutionary patterns among the Caryophyllales. Within the non-core above, the first analysis I conducted in my PhD found the group had a large number of inferred genome duplications. [This paper](https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3732/ajb.1700083) was focused on studying the molecular evolution of the carnvirous plants. From a methodological perspective the paper also illustrates how sensitive a relationship can be to sampling, even when using genome scale data. The picture below depicts the inferred relationships from the first chapter of my PhD.

**This is the depiction of the non-core Caryophyllales relationships from the first chapter of my PhD. Gene tree conflict is again depicted on pie charts, major evolutionary changes are shown on the branches they inferred to have occured, the numbers on the branches are the predicted number of gene duplications to have occured on the branch, and the circles represent the inferred genome duplications**


Some other projects I have been involved in have contributed to the body of literature in Caryophyllales by showing the Order as a whole has a propensity for [genome duplications](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.14812), these duplications are correlated with [rate shifts and moving to new enviornments](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.14772), and the family Portulacineae (containing Cacti and relatives) have some potentially important [gene family duplications with respect to C4 and CAM photosynthesis](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/36/1/112/5146340).
