### Current projects

**Large Scale Phylogenetics of Hibiscus**

Although _Hibiscus trionum_ remains an exemplar system for studying [bullseye patterns and iridescence](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24285), the species exists in an equally exciting group called the Trionum complex. This small clade has yet to be characterized from an evolutionary standpoint. A project I am currently working on that leads into future projects is placing these species and sub-species in phylogenies, for downstream trait analysis and characterization.
