### Work on plant transformations

This work is largely inspired to understand the potential genetic techniques developed in the world of developmental biology have on helping understand evolution. As a graduate student I had a large focus on computational methods development and during my postdoc I have been learning a large amount about the underlying biology and how to design experiments that capture biological signal as opposed to noise. As such, in my postdoctoral work I am looking at genes that show particularly interesting patterns in their evolutionary history, such as conflicting with the evolutionary history of the species, and examining the function of the genes in planta. This typically involves the development of transformed lines, using techniques such as overexpression, and CRISPR.
