### Research Interests

I am a botanist and a computational molecular evolutionary biologists, who seeks to understand the patterns seen in next generation sequencing data, by using techniques developed in the field of developmental biology. To be a bit more specific, I develop computational tools, typically for using large scale phylogenetic datasets, that can be used to find patterns in the data. This can be a gene whose evolutionary history conflicts with the species tree or which appears disproportionately influential in an analysis. Prior to my postdoctoral work my research products would usually end with quantifying these patterns and looking for correlations with other signal in the data. In my postdoctoral research I am using the genes identified as a basis for future work, where I apply tools that are typical of developmental biology (eg. CRISPR) and work to see he influence the genes have in vivo. I've broken my research into more specifics below.

### Brief History of where my research career has taken me

I've been lucky enough to have spent time in the labs of a number of wonderful people who are also great scientists and mentors. Each lab I have been in has taught me invaluable skills and helped me grow as an academic and a person. A special thanks goes to the labs of [Dr. Michael Zanis](https://www.seattleu.edu/scieng/about/faculty-and-staff/), [Dr. Nancy Emery](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/emery/) and [Dr. Antonia Monteiro](http://lepdata.org/monteiro/), all of whom hosted me at some point during my undergraduate career at Purdue University. During my Master's degree at Purdue I had the chance to continue learning from [Dr. Nancy Emery](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/emery/) and worked in the Purdue Bioinformatics Core under the guidance of [Dr. Jyothi Thimmapuram](https://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/bioinformatics/). I then pursued a PhD at the University of Michigan, where I was co-advised by [Dr. Stephen A. Smith](http://blackrim.org/) and [Dr. Patricia J. Wittkopp](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/wittkopp-lab/). During my time at Michigan I visited the lab of [Dr. Samuel Brockington](https://www.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/directory/brockington-sam) and had the opportunity to spend time at the [Cambridge University Botanic Garden](https://www.botanic.cam.ac.uk/) and take advantage of the huge collection of Caryophyllales they have. From there I continued as a postdoc in the lab of [Dr. Stephen A. Smith](http://blackrim.org/) for three months, before moving to Cambridge to continue my career in the lab of [Dr. Edwige Moyroud](https://www.slcu.cam.ac.uk/people/dr-edwige-moyroud). A huge thanks to all the people on this list!
