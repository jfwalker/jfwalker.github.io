### Research Interests

I am a botanist and a computational molecular evolutionary biologists, who seeks to understand the patterns seen in next generation sequencing data, by using techniques developed in the field of developmental biology. To be a bit more specific, I develop computational tools, typically for using large scale phylogenetic datasets, that can be used to find patterns in the data. This can be a gene whose evolutionary history conflicts with the species tree or which appears disproportionately influential in an analysis. Prior to my postdoctoral work my research products would usually end with quantifying these patterns and looking for correlations with other signal in the data. In my postdoctoral research I am using the genes identified as a basis for future work, where I apply tools that are typical of developmental biology (eg. CRISPR) and work to see he influence the genes have in vivo. 

At the core my work bridges the gap between developmental biology and evolutionary biology to see how the two are capable of informing one another. The analogy that I typically use is that developmental biology can be seen similar to weather, and evolutionary biology in this analogy is climate. The two fields study very different time scales, however, there is a degree of overlap. Climate, can be loosely defined as the change in weather conditions over a long period. Both fields use different tools, measurements, and approaches to understand what is going on. In this analogy my research is predicting hurricanes, in that work people have to combine weather trends and climactic patterns, with current weather data to predict when these will occur. Predicting hurricanes requires a use of shared tools between the climate scientists and meteorologists, it bridges the gap between the two fields. In my work I use the tools shared between developmental biology and evolutionary biology, to understand adaptations. With microscopy work, I look at the characteristics underlying a trait (eg. bullseye pattern), such as cell shape, size and distribution, to then understand how the components of that trait are correlated throughout time. Another example is that when a pattern is found, such as genes whose evolutionary history conflicts with the species history, I am looking at the effects of generating transformed lines based on those patterns. My work is a synthesis between the two fields, and thus requires a significant amount of designing novel computational tools. Now this is an over simplification and not a perfect analogy by any means but hopefully it provides some insight into the research I am doing and my goal of understanding adaptations from both a developmental lens and an evolutionary lens.

I've broken my research into more specifics below.

### Brief History of where my research career has taken me

I've been lucky enough to have spent time in the labs of a number of wonderful people who are also great scientists and mentors. Each lab I have been in has taught me invaluable skills and helped me grow as an academic and a person. A special thanks goes to the labs of [Dr. Michael Zanis](https://www.seattleu.edu/scieng/about/faculty-and-staff/), [Dr. Nancy Emery](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/emery/) and [Dr. Antonia Monteiro](http://lepdata.org/monteiro/), all of whom hosted me at some point during my undergraduate career at Purdue University. During my Master's degree at Purdue I had the chance to continue learning from [Dr. Nancy Emery](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/emery/) and worked in the Purdue Bioinformatics Core under the guidance of [Dr. Jyothi Thimmapuram](https://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/bioinformatics/). I then pursued a PhD at the University of Michigan, where I was co-advised by [Dr. Stephen A. Smith](http://blackrim.org/) and [Dr. Patricia J. Wittkopp](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/wittkopp-lab/). During my time at Michigan I visited the lab of [Dr. Samuel Brockington](https://www.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/directory/brockington-sam) and had the opportunity to spend time at the [Cambridge University Botanic Garden](https://www.botanic.cam.ac.uk/) and take advantage of the huge collection of Caryophyllales they have. From there I continued as a postdoc in the lab of [Dr. Stephen A. Smith](http://blackrim.org/) for three months, before moving to Cambridge to continue my career in the lab of [Dr. Edwige Moyroud](https://www.slcu.cam.ac.uk/people/dr-edwige-moyroud). A huge thanks to all the people on this list!
