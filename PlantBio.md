### Overview

An overarching theme of my research are the subjects of Plant Biology and Data Analysis. These can be found in almost every paper I have been a part of. During my Master's degree I was in the Botany and Plant Pathology department while also working in a bioinformatics core and studying computational life sciences in the CS department. The reason for this is because as we understand what emerges based on interactions of the data with the methods used, we can find what is analytical and what is biological. Once we successfully disentangle these two processes we can really begin understanding some cool biology, because patterns emerge from both aspects of the data interacting with the method and the biological signal of the data.

**Plant Biology**

My work in plant biology focuses on everything from studying macro-evolutionary patterns that shape plant distribution across deep time (~450 mya since divergence), to focusing on the specific details with regards to small closely related (~5mya since divergence) clades. I've always had a large focus on non-model species, and have had the opportunity to study exciting plants with fascinating adaptations. These include carnvirous plants, cacti, and plants with adaptations to extreme enviornments. Although, the studies I cover quite a bit of ground, from phylogenomics to microscopy, they do have an underlying them of trying to understand the world of plants.

**Data Analysis**

This is another major them in my research, and I believe is something important for all biologists. When looking for patterns in the data it is important to understand what patterns emerge from biology. In a study I did with regards to [conflict among genes in the chloroplast](https://peerj.com/articles/7747.pdf) genome, the null expectation would be that there is none. Few, examples exist of chloroplast recombination, and this would have to be combined with a relatively rapid divergence. However, in the study we found quite a noticeable amount of conflict underlying the data. The important aspect of this was, only one case really fit what would be expected by biology, but the fact that it exists outside of those biological cases is still important. From a data analysis standpoint this is interesting and it something that needs to be accounted for in analyses, even if it does not have a biological origin. As we account for more and more of the non-biological sources of signal in our data, we can find really cool biological signal.
